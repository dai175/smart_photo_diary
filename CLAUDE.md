## Architecture Overview

### Service Layer Pattern
The app follows a service-oriented architecture with singleton services using lazy initialization via `ServiceLocator`:

- **`DiaryService`**: Central data management with Hive database operations, depends on `AiService` for tag generation
- **`PhotoService`**: Photo access and permissions via `photo_manager` plugin, implements `PhotoServiceInterface`
- **`AiService`**: AI diary generation with Google Gemini API and comprehensive offline fallbacks, implements `AiServiceInterface`
- **`ImageClassifierService`**: On-device ML inference using TensorFlow Lite MobileNet v2
- **`SettingsService`**: App configuration stored in SharedPreferences
- **`StorageService`**: File system operations and data export functionality

### Dependency Injection
- **`ServiceLocator`**: Central dependency injection container supporting singleton, factory, and async factory patterns
- **`service_registration.dart`**: Contains service registration logic and initialization order
- Services are registered at app startup and accessed via interfaces for better testability

### Controller Pattern
- **`PhotoSelectionController`**: Uses `ChangeNotifier` for reactive photo selection state management
- **`DiaryScreenController`**: Manages diary screen state and interactions
- Controllers handle complex UI interactions and provide computed properties for widgets

### Screen Architecture
- **`HomeScreen`**: Main app entry point with bottom navigation
- **`DiaryScreen`**: Primary diary management interface
- **`DiaryDetailScreen`**: Individual diary entry viewing and editing
- **`DiaryPreviewScreen`**: Preview generated diary before saving
- **`SettingsScreen`**: App configuration and preferences
- **`StatisticsScreen`**: Analytics and insights dashboard

### Data Models
- **`DiaryEntry`**: Primary data model with Hive annotations for local storage
- **`DiaryFilter`**: Filtering and search criteria for diary queries
- Uses `build_runner` for generating Hive adapters (`diary_entry.g.dart`)

### AI/ML Architecture
- **On-device**: TensorFlow Lite MobileNet v2 model for image classification
- **Cloud AI**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash integration for advanced diary generation
- **AI Service Components**:
  - `GeminiApiClient`: Direct API integration with Google Gemini
  - `DiaryGenerator`: Core diary generation logic
  - `TagGenerator`: Automatic tag generation from content
  - `OfflineFallbackService`: Offline mode diary generation
- **Assets**: ML models bundled in `assets/models/` directory

### Widget Components
- **Shared Widgets**: `FilterBottomSheet`, `ActiveFiltersDisplay`
- **Feature Widgets**: `DiaryCardWidget`, `PhotoGridWidget`, `RecentDiariesWidget`
- **Utility Widgets**: `HomeContentWidget`, `DiarySearchWidget`

## Key Dependencies

### Core
- `hive` + `hive_flutter`: Local NoSQL database for diary storage
- `photo_manager`: Photo access and management with permission handling
- `tflite_flutter`: On-device ML inference for image classification
- `permission_handler`: Platform-specific permissions for photo access
- `connectivity_plus`: Network status checking for AI service fallbacks
- `image_picker`: Photo selection from gallery and camera
- `geolocator`: Location services for diary entries
- `table_calendar`: Calendar UI component for date navigation
- `flutter_dotenv`: Environment variable management
- `shared_preferences`: Simple key-value storage for app settings

### Development
- `build_runner` + `hive_generator`: Code generation for Hive adapters
- `mocktail`: Testing framework for service mocking
- `flutter_lints`: Code analysis with custom rules

## Important Files

### Configuration
- `pubspec.yaml`: Dependencies and asset configuration
- `analysis_options.yaml`: Linting rules
- `.env`: Environment variables (API keys)

### Generated Code
- `lib/models/diary_entry.g.dart`: Auto-generated Hive adapter (do not edit manually)

### Assets
- `assets/models/mobilenet_v2_1.0_224_quant.tflite`: TensorFlow Lite model
- `assets/models/labels.txt`: Image classification labels

## Development Notes

### Code Generation
Always run `fvm dart run build_runner build` after modifying Hive model classes to regenerate adapters.

### Code Quality Standards
- Always run `fvm flutter analyze` before committing code - currently no warnings, only minor info-level suggestions
- Custom lint rules enforce single quotes, const constructors, and performance optimizations
- Fix all analyzer warnings and errors immediately to maintain code quality
- Project uses Japanese comments for business logic documentation
- Test suite must maintain 100% success rate - all failing tests should be investigated and either fixed or removed

### Service Dependencies
Services follow a clear dependency hierarchy:
- `DiaryService` → `AiService` (for background tag generation)
- `AiService` → Connectivity checking for online/offline modes
- All services use dependency injection rather than tight coupling

### Testing Architecture
The project follows a comprehensive 3-tier testing strategy:

#### Unit Tests (`test/unit/`)
- **Pure logic testing** with mocked dependencies using `mocktail`
- **Service mock tests**: `*_service_mock_test.dart` files test service interfaces without external dependencies
- **Model tests**: Test data structures, validation, and business logic
- **Core utilities**: Test dependency injection and utility functions

#### Widget Tests (`test/widget/`)
- **UI component testing** with mocked services via dependency injection
- Test widget rendering, user interactions, and state management
- Use `WidgetTestHelpers` for common test setup and utilities

#### Integration Tests (`test/integration/`)
- **End-to-end flow testing** with real service implementations
- Test complete user workflows (photo selection → diary generation → saving)
- Use `IntegrationTestHelpers` for complex app state setup

#### Test Utilities
- **`MockPlatformChannels`**: Unified platform channel mocking
- **`WidgetTestHelpers`**: Common widget test utilities and setup
- **`IntegrationTestHelpers`**: Integration test environment setup

#### Testing Best Practices
- **Mock-first approach**: All external dependencies (APIs, platform channels, file systems) are mocked in unit tests
- **Interface-based testing**: Services implement interfaces for easy mocking and dependency injection
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Each service has both unit tests (mocked) and integration tests (real implementations)
- **Test isolation**: Each test is independent with proper setup/teardown

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory for Google Gemini API keys and other configuration.

### Platform Considerations
The app supports multiple platforms but photo access requires platform-specific permissions handled by `permission_handler`.

### Privacy and Local Storage
All user data stays on device. Hive database files are stored in app documents directory. No cloud synchronization by design.
