# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Smart Photo Diary is a Flutter mobile application that generates diary entries from photos using AI. The app implements a freemium monetization model with Basic (free) and Premium subscription tiers. Core features include AI-powered diary generation, writing prompts, and complete offline functionality with privacy-first design.

## Development Commands

### Setup and Dependencies
```bash
# Get dependencies (using FVM)
fvm flutter pub get

# Code generation for Hive models (using FVM)
fvm dart run build_runner build

# Force rebuild generated code
fvm dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### CI/CD and GitHub Actions
```bash
# Trigger CI/CD pipeline (automatic on push/PR to main/develop)
git push origin main

# Create release (triggers release.yml workflow)
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0

# Manual deployment workflows require GitHub Secrets:
# - GEMINI_API_KEY: Google Gemini API key for production builds
# - GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT: Android deployment credentials  
# - APPSTORE_ISSUER_ID, APPSTORE_KEY_ID, APPSTORE_PRIVATE_KEY: iOS deployment
# - ANDROID_SIGNING_KEY, ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD: Android signing
```

### Development
```bash
# Run app in development (using FVM)
fvm flutter run

# Hot reload and hot restart are available during development
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests (using FVM) - Currently 683 tests with 100% success rate
fvm flutter test

# Run only unit tests (pure logic, mocked dependencies)
fvm flutter test test/unit/

# Run only widget tests (UI components)
fvm flutter test test/widget/

# Run only integration tests (full app flows)
fvm flutter test test/integration/

# Run unit + integration tests combined
fvm flutter test test/unit/ test/integration/

# Run specific test file
fvm flutter test test/unit/services/diary_service_mock_test.dart

# Run tests with coverage
fvm flutter test --coverage

# Run tests with verbose output
fvm flutter test --reporter expanded

# Run tests with JSON reporter (for CI/debugging)
fvm flutter test --reporter json
```

### Build Commands
```bash
# Debug build
fvm flutter build apk --debug

# Release builds
fvm flutter build apk --release
fvm flutter build appbundle
fvm flutter build ipa

# Build for specific platforms
fvm flutter build macos
fvm flutter build windows
fvm flutter build linux

# Install release APK on connected Android device
adb install build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk

# Launch app on device
adb shell am start -n com.example.smart_photo_diary/.MainActivity
```

### Linting and Code Quality
```bash
# Analyze code (configured to suppress info-level lints for cleaner output)
fvm flutter analyze

# Fix formatting (REQUIRED after any code changes)
fvm dart format .

# Check formatting without changing files (CI/CD safe)
fvm dart format --set-exit-if-changed .

# Check for outdated dependencies
fvm flutter pub outdated
```

### Code Formatting Requirements
**IMPORTANT**: Always run `fvm dart format .` after making any code changes to ensure consistent formatting:

```bash
# Standard workflow after code changes:
1. Make your code changes
2. fvm dart format .        # Format code automatically
3. fvm flutter analyze     # Check for issues
4. fvm flutter test        # Run tests
5. git add . && git commit  # Commit changes
```

The CI/CD pipeline uses `--set-exit-if-changed` flag and will fail if code is not properly formatted. This ensures consistent code style across the entire codebase.

## Architecture Overview

### Service Layer Pattern
The app follows a service-oriented architecture with singleton services using lazy initialization via `ServiceLocator`:

- **`DiaryService`**: Central data management with Hive database operations, depends on `AiService` for tag generation
- **`PhotoService`**: Photo access and permissions via `photo_manager` plugin, implements `PhotoServiceInterface`
- **`AiService`**: AI diary generation with Google Gemini API and comprehensive offline fallbacks, implements `AiServiceInterface`
- **`ImageClassifierService`**: On-device ML inference capabilities (placeholder for future ML integration)
- **`SettingsService`**: App configuration stored in SharedPreferences with Result<T> pattern for write operations
- **`StorageService`**: File system operations, data export functionality with user-selectable destinations, and database optimization
- **`LoggingService`**: Structured logging with levels and performance monitoring
- **`SubscriptionService`**: In-App Purchase integration for Premium subscriptions, implements `ISubscriptionService`
- **`PromptService`**: Writing prompt management with JSON asset loading, 3-tier caching system, freemium filtering, and comprehensive search capabilities, implements `IPromptService`

### Error Handling Architecture

The app implements a **Result<T> pattern** for functional error handling, providing type-safe alternatives to exception-based error handling:

#### Result<T> Pattern (`lib/core/result/`)
- **`Result<T>`**: Sealed class with `Success<T>` and `Failure<T>` variants
- **Functional operations**: `map`, `fold`, `chain`, `onSuccess`, `onFailure`
- **Helper utilities**: `ResultHelper` for easy creation and combination
- **Extensions**: Enhanced support for `Future<Result<T>>` and `List<Result<T>>`

#### Standardized Exception Hierarchy (`lib/core/errors/`)
- **`AppException`**: Base exception with message, details, and original error context
- **Domain-specific exceptions**: `ServiceException`, `PhotoAccessException`, `AiProcessingException`, etc.
- **`ErrorHandler`**: Utilities for error conversion, logging, and safe execution
- **`LoggingService`**: Structured logging with context and performance monitoring

### Dependency Injection
- **`ServiceLocator`**: Central dependency injection container supporting singleton, factory, and async factory patterns
- **`service_registration.dart`**: Contains service registration logic and initialization order with LoggingService integration
- Services are registered at app startup and accessed via interfaces for better testability
- **Service Dependencies**: PromptService depends on LoggingService; AiService depends on SubscriptionService; DiaryService depends on AiService and PhotoService

### Controller Pattern
- **`PhotoSelectionController`**: Uses `ChangeNotifier` for reactive photo selection state management with enhanced robustness and boundary checking
- **`DiaryScreenController`**: Manages diary screen state and interactions
- Controllers handle complex UI interactions and provide computed properties for widgets

### Data Models
- **`DiaryEntry`**: Primary data model with Hive annotations for local storage
- **`DiaryFilter`**: Filtering and search criteria for diary queries
- **`WritingPrompt`**: Writing prompt model with categories, tags, and Premium/Basic classification
- **`SubscriptionPlan`**: Subscription plan definitions (Basic, Premium Monthly/Yearly)
- **`SubscriptionStatus`**: Current subscription state with usage tracking
- Uses `build_runner` for generating Hive adapters (`diary_entry.g.dart`, `writing_prompt.g.dart`)

### AI/ML Architecture
- **Cloud AI**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash integration for advanced diary generation
- **AI Service Components**:
  - `GeminiApiClient`: Direct API integration with Google Gemini, enhanced with EnvironmentConfig
  - `DiaryGenerator`: Core diary generation logic
  - `TagGenerator`: Automatic tag generation from content
  - `OfflineFallbackService`: Offline mode diary generation
- **Environment Management**: EnvironmentConfig provides robust API key management with validation
- **Assets**: Writing prompts and configuration data in `assets/data/` directory

### Monetization Architecture
- **Freemium Model**: Basic (free, 10 AI generations/month) vs Premium (Â¥300/month, 100 generations + prompts)
- **In-App Purchase Integration**: Uses `in_app_purchase` plugin for subscription management
- **Usage Tracking**: AI generation counts with monthly reset functionality
- **Writing Prompts System**: 20 curated prompts (5 Basic + 15 Premium) across 8 categories
- **Plan Enforcement**: Feature access control based on subscription status

## Development Notes

### Security Guidelines (CRITICAL)
**Always prioritize security best practices over convenience:**

1. **Environment Variables**:
   - NEVER suggest including `.env` files in `assets/` or application bundles
   - Always use project root placement: `/project-root/.env`
   - Use `dotenv.load(fileName: ".env")` to load from root, not assets

2. **API Key Management**:
   - Local development: `.env` in project root (gitignored)
   - CI/CD: GitHub Secrets with dynamic `.env` creation
   - Production: Environment variables or secure platform storage
   - NEVER bundle API keys in APK/IPA files

3. **Security-First Decision Making**:
   - When in doubt, choose the more secure option
   - Verify industry best practices before suggesting solutions
   - Consider long-term security implications of architectural decisions

### Git Operations and Development Rules (CRITICAL)
**IMPORTANT**: Always follow these rules when working with Git and making code changes:

#### Git Operations
1. **Never commit without explicit user approval**:
   - Complete code modifications and testing first
   - Report changes and results to user
   - Wait for user's explicit instruction to commit
   - Confirm commit message with user before executing

2. **Commit Guidelines**:
   - Only commit when functionality is tested and confirmed working
   - Never commit untested code or "work in progress"
   - Use descriptive commit messages that explain the "why" not just "what"
   - Follow the existing commit message format

#### Security in Code
1. **API Keys and Secrets**:
   - NEVER hardcode API keys, passwords, or tokens in source code
   - Use only environment variables, config files, or build-time constants
   - If unsure about security implications, always ask user first

2. **Git History Security**:
   - Be aware that Git history is permanent and public when pushed
   - If secrets are accidentally committed, immediately inform user
   - Never attempt to "fix" security issues by adding new commits

### Code Generation
Always run `fvm dart run build_runner build` after modifying Hive model classes to regenerate adapters.

### Code Quality Standards
- Always run `fvm flutter analyze` before committing code - currently **no issues** (clean codebase)
- Custom lint rules enforce single quotes, const constructors, and performance optimizations
- Fix all analyzer warnings and errors immediately to maintain code quality
- Project uses Japanese comments for business logic documentation
- Test suite must maintain 100% success rate - all failing tests should be investigated and either fixed or removed

### UI Development Guidelines
- **Modal Design**: Always use CustomDialog for new modals and avoid AlertDialog
- **Text Alignment**: Use left-aligned text (textAlign: TextAlign.left) for user-facing content
- **Layout Constraints**: Avoid fixed heights and use natural layouts (Flexible, Expanded, etc.)
- **Visual Consistency**: Follow design system for icons, colors, and button styles
- **Responsive Design**: Create flexible layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and content lengths
- **User Experience**: Prioritize intuitive interactions and visual feedback

### Japanese Language Development
- **UI text**: All user-facing text is in Japanese
- **Comments**: Business logic and complex algorithms documented in Japanese
- **Variable names**: Use descriptive English names for code clarity
- **Debug messages**: May use Japanese for user-facing debug information

### UI Design Guidelines
- **No gradients**: All gradients have been removed for cleaner, simpler design
- **Consistent headers**: All screens use standard AppBar styling with unified colors and typography
- **Button consistency**: All buttons use solid colors (AppColors.primary/accent) instead of gradients
- **Material Design 3**: Follow MD3 principles with emphasis on solid colors and clean layouts
- **Typography standardization**: Section headings use AppTypography.headlineSmall (24sp) across all screens
- **Theme-aware colors**: Always use `Theme.of(context).colorScheme` for dynamic colors instead of fixed AppColors
- **Custom Dialog System**: Unified modal design with CustomDialog components
  - Complete migration from AlertDialog to CustomDialog
  - Standardized PresetDialogs (success, error, confirmation, usageLimit)
  - Consistent icons, color schemes, and button styles
- **Text Alignment Standards**: Left-aligned text following industry standards (textAlign: TextAlign.left)
  - All modal text uses left alignment (except loading messages)
  - Improved readability and natural reading flow
- **Responsive Layout Design**: Natural layout design avoiding fixed heights
  - Diary preview screen: Removed fixed height (400px) for natural sizing
  - Content input field: minLines: 12, maxLines: null for long text support
  - Optimized spacing for efficient screen space utilization
- **Photo Dialog Optimization**: Enhanced photo display dialogs
  - Proper close button positioning (top: -10, right: -10)
  - Visual improvements with clipBehavior: Clip.none
  - Optimized button size, background opacity, and border styling

### Error Handling Patterns

#### Result<T> Usage Guidelines
- **New features MUST use Result<T> pattern** for all operations that can fail (I/O, network, validation, etc.)
- **Existing code should be migrated gradually** - do not change service interfaces all at once
- **Start with write operations** (save, update, delete) as they typically have simpler return types
- **Prefer Result<void> for operations without return values** to minimize type complexity

#### Current Implementation Status
- **â Complete foundation**: Result<T> core implementation with comprehensive utilities and 100% test coverage
- **â Partial adoption**: SettingsService uses Result<T> for write operations (`setThemeMode`, `setAccentColor`, `setGenerationMode`)
- **ð Legacy support**: Existing service interfaces still use exception-based patterns for backward compatibility
- **ð Migration targets**: DiaryService, PhotoService, AiService are candidates for gradual Result<T> adoption

#### Migration Strategy for Future Development
1. **Phase 1 - New Features** (Immediate):
   - All new service methods MUST return Result<T>
   - New services SHOULD implement Result<T> from the start
   - Use ResultHelper utilities for easy creation and error handling

2. **Phase 2 - Write Operations** (Next priority):
   - Migrate service write methods (save, update, delete) to Result<T>
   - Update corresponding UI error handling to use `fold()` pattern
   - Maintain backward compatibility with wrapper methods if needed

3. **Phase 3 - Read Operations** (Lower priority):
   - Migrate service read methods (get, list, search) to Result<T>
   - Update service interfaces gradually, one service at a time
   - Ensure comprehensive testing at each step

#### Best Practices
- **Use ResultHelper.tryExecuteAsync()** for wrapping existing exception-based code
- **Implement ErrorHandler.safeExecute()** for gradual migration of legacy code
- **Always test both success and failure paths** when implementing Result<T>
- **Use structured logging** via LoggingService for consistent error reporting and debugging
- **Avoid changing service interfaces and implementations simultaneously** - update incrementally

### Service Dependencies
Services follow a clear dependency hierarchy:
- `DiaryService` â `AiService` (for background tag generation)
- `AiService` â `SubscriptionService` (for usage limit checking)
- `PromptService` â `LoggingService` (for structured logging and performance monitoring)
- `AiService` â Connectivity checking for online/offline modes
- All services use dependency injection rather than tight coupling

### Writing Prompts System  
- **PromptService Implementation**: Complete Phase 2.2.1 implementation with singleton pattern, JSON asset loading, and 3-tier caching
- **Data Structure**: JSON file with 20 prompts across 8 categories (daily, travel, work, gratitude, reflection, creative, wellness, relationships)
- **Plan Distribution**: Basic users get 5 prompts (daily + gratitude), Premium users get all 20
- **Caching Architecture**: Plan-based cache, category-based cache, and ID-based cache for optimal performance
- **Search Capabilities**: Full-text search across prompt text, tags, and descriptions with plan enforcement
- **Random Selection**: Weighted random selection based on priority values with category filtering
- **Utility Classes**: `PromptCategoryUtils` for filtering, statistics, and plan-based access control
- **UI Implementation**: Complete Phase 2.3.1 WritingPromptsScreen with navigation integration
- **Quality Assurance**: 45 comprehensive tests (26 unit + 11 mock + 8 integration) with 100% success rate

### Testing Architecture
The project follows a comprehensive 3-tier testing strategy with **100% success rate** (683 passing tests):

#### Unit Tests (`test/unit/`)
- **Pure logic testing** with mocked dependencies using `mocktail`
- **Service mock tests**: `*_service_mock_test.dart` files test service interfaces without external dependencies
- **Core utilities**: Test dependency injection, Result<T> pattern, and utility functions
- **Data validation**: Writing prompts data integrity tests with 12 test cases
- **Subscription system**: Comprehensive tests for monetization features and usage tracking
- **Enhanced robustness**: All PhotoSelectionController methods include boundary checking and input validation

#### Widget Tests (`test/widget/`)
- **UI component testing** with mocked services via dependency injection
- Test widget rendering, user interactions, and state management
- Use `WidgetTestHelpers` for common test setup and utilities

#### Integration Tests (`test/integration/`)
- **End-to-end flow testing** with real service implementations
- Test complete user workflows (photo selection â diary generation â saving)
- Use `IntegrationTestHelpers` for complex app state setup

#### Test Utilities
- **`MockPlatformChannels`**: Unified platform channel mocking
- **`WidgetTestHelpers`**: Common widget test utilities and setup
- **`IntegrationTestHelpers`**: Integration test environment setup

#### Testing Best Practices
- **Mock-first approach**: All external dependencies (APIs, platform channels, file systems) are mocked in unit tests
- **Interface-based testing**: Services implement interfaces for easy mocking and dependency injection
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Each service has both unit tests (mocked) and integration tests (real implementations)
- **Test isolation**: Each test is independent with proper setup/teardown
- **Result<T> testing**: Comprehensive unit tests for functional error handling patterns

### Environment Variables and Configuration

#### Security Best Practices
**CRITICAL**: Always follow these security guidelines when handling environment variables and API keys:

1. **NEVER include `.env` files in assets or application bundles**
   - Assets are extractable from APK/IPA files, exposing API keys
   - This is a major security vulnerability that can lead to API key theft

2. **Proper `.env` file management**:
   - **Local Development**: Place `.env` file in project root directory
   - **Version Control**: Always add `.env` to `.gitignore` (never commit API keys)
   - **CI/CD**: Use GitHub Secrets or environment variables, create `.env` dynamically
   - **Production**: Use platform-specific secure storage or environment variables

#### Implementation Details
- **`.env` file location**: Project root directory (`/project-root/.env`)
- **EnvironmentConfig**: Robust environment variable management with caching and validation (`lib/config/environment_config.dart`)
- **Loading method**: `dotenv.load(fileName: ".env")` loads from project root, not assets
- **Android permissions**: Release builds require INTERNET permissions in AndroidManifest.xml for API calls

#### Environment Variable Loading Strategy
```dart
// CORRECT: Load from project root
await dotenv.load(fileName: ".env");

// INCORRECT: Load from assets (security risk)
await dotenv.load(); // This loads from assets by default
```

#### CI/CD Environment Handling
- **GitHub Actions**: Creates `.env` file dynamically from secrets before build
- **Local Development**: Uses `.env` file from project root
- **Production Builds**: API keys injected via CI/CD secrets, never bundled in assets

#### Development Plan Override (Debug Mode Only)
For testing purposes, you can force a specific subscription plan in debug mode:
- **Environment variable**: `FORCE_PLAN` in `.env` file
- **Build-time constant**: `--dart-define=FORCE_PLAN=premium`
- **Valid values**: `basic`, `premium`, `premium_monthly`, `premium_yearly`
- **Security**: Automatically disabled in release builds (`kDebugMode` check)
- **Usage examples**:
  ```bash
  # Via .env file
  FORCE_PLAN=premium
  
  # Via build command
  fvm flutter run --dart-define=FORCE_PLAN=premium
  fvm flutter build apk --debug --dart-define=FORCE_PLAN=premium
  ```

### Platform Considerations
The app supports multiple platforms but photo access requires platform-specific permissions handled by `permission_handler`.

### iOS Photo Permission Implementation
**CRITICAL**: iOS photo permissions require specific implementation patterns for reliable operation:

#### Required Info.plist Keys
```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>åçã©ã¤ãã©ãªã«ã¢ã¯ã»ã¹ãã¦ãæ¥è¨ä½æã«ä½¿ç¨ããåçãåå¾ãã¾ã</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>åçã©ã¤ãã©ãªã«æ°ããåçãä¿å­ãã¾ã</string>
<key>PHPhotoLibraryPreventAutomaticLimitedAccessAlert</key>
<true/>
```

#### Permission Implementation Strategy
- **Dual Plugin Approach**: Use both `PhotoManager` and `permission_handler` for robust permission handling
- **PhotoManager**: Primary for photo access and Limited Photo Access detection
- **permission_handler**: Secondary for permission state checking and settings navigation

#### Limited Photo Access Handling (iOS 14+)
**IMPORTANT**: Limited Photo Access is a common user choice and must be properly supported:

1. **Detection**: Use `PermissionState.limited` from PhotoManager
2. **User Guidance**: Show explanatory dialog when photo count is low
3. **Photo Selection**: Use `PhotoManager.presentLimited()` to show selection UI
4. **Graceful Degradation**: App functions with selected photos only

#### Permission State Management
```dart
// Correct approach for permission checking
final pmState = await PhotoManager.requestPermissionExtend();
if (pmState.isAuth || pmState == PermissionState.limited) {
  // Both full and limited access are usable
  return true;
}
```

#### User Experience Best Practices
- **Never surprise users**: Always show explanatory dialog before opening Settings
- **Clear messaging**: Explain why permissions are needed and what Limited Access means
- **Settings navigation**: Use `openAppSettings()` with proper user consent
- **App lifecycle handling**: Check permissions when returning from Settings via `AppLifecycleState.resumed`

#### Bundle ID Considerations
- **Fresh permissions**: Changing Bundle ID resets all permission states
- **Clean installs**: Always test with fresh app installs to verify permission flows
- **Developer profiles**: Ensure proper signing and device trust for permission dialogs to appear

### Japanese Font Support
- **Locale configuration**: MaterialApp configured with Japanese locale (`ja_JP`) to ensure proper font selection
- **Font rendering**: Prevents Chinese font variants from displaying for Japanese text
- **Debug tools**: Font debug screen available in settings for testing font rendering (`/debug/font_debug_screen.dart`)

### Dark Theme Support
- **Complete theme integration**: All UI components properly support both light and dark themes
- **Text visibility**: All text colors use `Theme.of(context).colorScheme` instead of fixed AppColors for proper contrast
- **Modal consistency**: Custom dialogs automatically adapt colors based on current theme
- **Settings screen**: Proper contrast for secondary text and icons in dark mode

### Privacy and Local Storage
All user data stays on device. Hive database files are stored in app documents directory. No cloud synchronization by design.

## CI/CD and Deployment Architecture

### GitHub Actions Workflows
The project includes 4 automated workflows with distinct purposes:

#### 1. **ci.yml** - Continuous Integration
- **Trigger**: Push/PR to main/develop branches
- **Purpose**: Code quality validation and testing only
- **API Key**: Uses `dummy_key_for_ci` (unified dummy key for all CI builds)
- **Actions**: Run tests, analyze code, build debug/release APKs and iOS builds for verification
- **Artifacts**: No artifacts uploaded (builds are for verification only, contain dummy API keys)

#### 2. **release.yml** - GitHub Releases
- **Trigger**: Version tags (`v*`) or manual execution
- **Purpose**: Create GitHub Releases with downloadable builds
- **API Key**: Requires `${{ secrets.GEMINI_API_KEY }}` (fails if not set)
- **Output**: APK, AAB, iOS archive with SHA256 checksums
- **Target**: Developers, testers, direct distribution

#### 3. **android-deploy.yml** - Google Play Store
- **Trigger**: Manual execution only (`workflow_dispatch`)
- **Purpose**: Controlled deployment to Google Play Store
- **Requirements**: Google Play Console setup, service account, app registration
- **API Key**: Requires `${{ secrets.GEMINI_API_KEY }}` (fails if not set)
- **Output**: Signed AAB uploaded to Play Store (internal/alpha/beta/production tracks)

#### 4. **ios-deploy.yml** - App Store
- **Trigger**: Manual execution only (`workflow_dispatch`)
- **Purpose**: Controlled deployment to TestFlight/App Store
- **Requirements**: App Store Connect setup, certificates, app registration
- **API Key**: Requires `${{ secrets.GEMINI_API_KEY }}` (fails if not set)
- **Output**: Signed IPA uploaded to TestFlight or App Store

### Required GitHub Secrets
For production deployments, configure these repository secrets:
```bash
# Core API (required for all production builds)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key

# Android deployment (android-deploy.yml)
GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=service_account_json
ANDROID_SIGNING_KEY=base64_encoded_keystore
ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=keystore_password
ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS=key_alias
ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD=key_password

# iOS deployment (ios-deploy.yml)
APPSTORE_ISSUER_ID=app_store_connect_issuer_id
APPSTORE_KEY_ID=app_store_connect_key_id
APPSTORE_PRIVATE_KEY=app_store_connect_private_key
IOS_DISTRIBUTION_CERTIFICATE=p12_certificate_base64
IOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD=certificate_password
IOS_TEAM_ID=apple_team_id
```

### Deployment Strategy (Industry Standard)
- **Development**: Use ci.yml for code validation (automatic)
- **Beta Testing**: Use release.yml for GitHub Releases distribution (tag-triggered)
- **Store Distribution**: Use android-deploy.yml and ios-deploy.yml (manual execution only)

### Staged Release Flow
```bash
# 1. Development Quality Checks (Automatic)
git push origin main                    # â ci.yml execution

# 2. Beta Distribution (Semi-automatic)
git tag v1.0.0-beta
git push origin v1.0.0-beta           # â release.yml execution

# 3. Production Distribution (Manual)
# Execute manually via GitHub Actions UI:
# - android-deploy.yml â Google Play Store
# - ios-deploy.yml â App Store/TestFlight
```

### Important Notes
- **CI vs Production**: CI uses dummy API keys and produces no artifacts; production workflows require real secrets
- **Secret Validation**: All production workflows (release, android-deploy, ios-deploy) fail immediately if GEMINI_API_KEY is not set
- **Store Registration**: Store deployment workflows will fail until apps are registered in respective stores
- **API Key Security**: CI workflows intentionally use dummy keys to avoid exposing real API keys during testing
- **Manual Control**: Production deployments require manual execution for safety and quality control
- **Industry Standard**: Follows best practices used by major tech companies for risk mitigation

// Category popularity with trends
final categoryAnalysis = await promptService.analyzeCategoryPopularity(
  days: 30, isPremium: true, comparePreviousPeriod: true);

// Detailed user behavior analysis  
final behaviorAnalysis = await promptService.analyzeDetailedUserBehavior(
  days: 30, isPremium: true);

- **Recommendation Engine**: Personalized suggestions based on usage patterns and satisfaction metrics

## UI Error Display System

### Unified Error Display Architecture
The application uses a unified error display system that provides consistent error presentation across all screens and components:

#### Core Components
- **ErrorDisplayService**: Centralized service for showing errors with automatic logging and severity-based display methods
- **ErrorDisplayWidgets**: Reusable UI components (SnackBar, Dialog, Inline, FullScreen) with consistent styling
- **ErrorSeverity**: Four-level severity system (info, warning, error, critical) with appropriate visual feedback
- **ErrorDisplayConfig**: Predefined configurations for common error scenarios

#### Error Display Methods
1. **SnackBar**: Lightweight notifications for info/warning messages
2. **Dialog**: Modal alerts for errors requiring user acknowledgment  
3. **Inline**: Embedded error displays within content areas
4. **FullScreen**: Critical errors that block entire app functionality

#### Error Severity Levels
- **Info**: Informational messages (blue, SnackBar, 3s duration)
- **Warning**: Cautionary messages (orange, SnackBar, 4s duration)
- **Error**: Standard errors (red, Dialog, user dismissible)
- **Critical**: Severe errors (dark red, Dialog, retry required, non-dismissible)

#### Integration with Result<T>
The error display system is fully integrated with the Result<T> pattern:

```dart
// Direct error display from Result
result.showErrorOnUI(context);

// With success message
await operation()
  .showResultOnUI(context, 
    onSuccess: (value) => 'Successfully saved!');

// Conditional error display
result.showErrorOnUIOfType<NetworkException>(context);
```

#### Usage Patterns

**Service Layer Integration**:
```dart
class MyController extends BaseErrorController {
  Future<void> performAction(BuildContext context) async {
    await executeWithErrorDisplay(
      context,
      () => myService.doSomething(),
      errorConfig: ErrorDisplayConfig.criticalWithRetry,
      onRetry: () => performAction(context),
    );
  }
}
```

**UI Extensions**:
```dart
// Simple error display
context.showError(ServiceException('Failed to save'));

// Success messages
context.showSuccess('Data saved successfully!');

// Type-specific errors
context.showNetworkError('Connection failed', onRetry: retry);
```

**Widget Builders**:
```dart
FutureResultUIBuilder<List<Item>>(
  future: loadItems(),
  onSuccess: (items) => ItemList(items: items),
  showDialogErrors: true, // Show errors in dialogs
  onRetry: loadItems,
)
```

#### Best Practices
- **Use predefined ErrorDisplayConfig** for consistent behavior
- **Leverage BaseErrorController** for automatic error state management
- **Prefer contextual extensions** (context.showError) for brevity
- **Always provide retry mechanisms** for recoverable errors
- **Use severity levels appropriately** to guide user response

## Code Quality and Analysis

### Analyzer Configuration
The project uses a customized `analysis_options.yaml` configuration that:
- **Suppresses info-level lints** for cleaner output in production
- **Maintains strict error and warning detection** for actual code problems
- **Excludes generated files** (*.g.dart, *.freezed.dart) from analysis
- **Enforces consistent coding standards** through targeted linting rules

### Analyzer Philosophy
- **Zero tolerance for errors and warnings**: All error and warning-level issues must be resolved
- **Info-level suppression for mature codebase**: Style hints are suppressed to focus on functional issues
- **Clean CI/CD integration**: `flutter analyze` returns clear success/failure status

### Suppressed Info Rules (Rationale)
- `prefer_const_constructors`: Performance optimization hint, not critical for functionality
- `avoid_redundant_argument_values`: Code style preference, doesn't affect behavior
- `unintended_html_in_doc_comment`: Documentation formatting issue, not functional problem

This configuration is appropriate for a mature, production-ready codebase where the focus should be on preventing actual bugs rather than enforcing every style preference.

## Storage Management Features

### Data Export with File Picker
The app includes comprehensive data export functionality:
- **User-selectable destinations**: Uses `file_picker` package for cross-platform file saving
- **JSON format export**: Complete diary data including tags, metadata, and timestamps
- **Filtered exports**: Support for date range filtering during export
- **Structured data format**: Includes app metadata, version info, and export timestamps

### Database Optimization
Storage optimization features include:
- **Hive database compaction**: Reduces file fragmentation and reclaims deleted data space
- **Temporary file cleanup**: Automatic removal of temporary files and directories
- **Cache management**: Deletes cache files older than 7 days
- **Storage monitoring**: Real-time storage usage reporting with formatted size display

### Implementation Notes
- **StorageService.exportData()**: Returns file path or null, uses FilePicker.platform.saveFile()
- **StorageService.optimizeDatabase()**: Calls DiaryService.compactDatabase() and cleanup methods
- **StorageInfo class**: Provides formatted storage size calculations and breakdown by data type
